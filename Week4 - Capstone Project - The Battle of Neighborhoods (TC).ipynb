    "For potential home owners who are interested in buying a property, the listings on websites often do not give great details on neighbourhood's amenities (i.e. Park, school, restaurants, bus stop, etc.). A great neighborhood should also include important amenities such as grocery stores, shops, and restaurants. Most people like to frequent places that are convenient. Schools are another important amenity. Even if you don't have kids, if you want to sell your home in the future, many buyers will be on the lookout for good schools. The quality of local schools and the distance from the house are both important factors to consider.\n",

    "Access to parks, recreation, shopping, restaurants and coffee shops is another key factor to a great neighbourhood. When the potential owner try to move to a new neighborhood, these are the neighborhood amenities to look into before purchasing a Home. In this project we will try to utilize Foursquare's location data to explore a neighbourhood's geographical location, as well as using KNN clustering, return the user the best neighborhood within the selected city.\n"
